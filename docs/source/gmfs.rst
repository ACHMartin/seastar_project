Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs)
==================================

This section is about the Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs) used for the data processing. 

Doppler
-------

The Doppler section aims to convert the Doppler shift to compute the total surface current correcting the Wind-wave Artefact Surface Velocity (WASV). 
Two models are used to compute he WASV: mouche12 and yurovsky19. 

All these methods are detailed below. q
