## 1. Installation

### 1.1 Download the **project_seastar** repository

Navigate to the latest release on th eRHS of this page and download and unzip the source code.


### 1.2 Create an environment with Anaconda

To run the code in the project you need to install the required Python packages in an environment. To do this we will use **Anaconda**, which can be downloaded freely [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

Open the Anaconda prompt (in Mac and Linux, open a terminal window) and use the `cd` command (change directory) to go the folder where you have downloaded the **project_seastar** repository.

Create a new environment named `seatar` with all the required packages and activate ti senvironment by entering these commands in succession:

```
>>> conda create --file env/environment.yml
>>> conda activate seastar
```

To confirm that you have successfully activated `seatar`, your terminal command line prompt should now start with (seatar).
